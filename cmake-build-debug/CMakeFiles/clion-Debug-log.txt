-- Could NOT find Boost (missing: Boost_INCLUDE_DIR) 
CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findixwebsocket.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ixwebsocket", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ixwebsocket" with
  any of the following names:

    ixwebsocketConfig.cmake
    ixwebsocket-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ixwebsocket" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ixwebsocket_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ixwebsocket" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (target_link_libraries):
  Target "extpr" links to:

    boost::boost

  but the target was not found.  Possible reasons include:

    * There is a typo in the target name.
    * A find_package call is missing for an IMPORTED target.
    * An ALIAS target is missing.
